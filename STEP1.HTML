    <p>1. Do a morning stretch
        Stretching before getting out of bed wakes up the body, improves circulation, and promotes r
        elaxation, helping to set the day's tone. While you're still lying in bed, move the covers aside, then flex and release your lower limbs several times. Bend your knees and lift your legs into the air. With your legs still elevated, flex your feet up and down and rotate them side to side. Next, sit up and slowly look left and then right. Roll your shoulders several times. Flex your wrists up and down, and open and close your hands repeatedly.

        2. Stay hydrated
        Proper hydration supports digestion, improves brain performance, and increases energy, among other health benefits. Drink a big glass of water after you wake up and a glass with every meal.

        3. Floss
        Maintaining good oral health includes daily flossing, but make sure you do it right. First, wrap the floss around your middle fingers, which helps you reach the back teeth. Then loop the floss around one side of a tooth, so it makes a C shape. Beginning at the gum line, slide it up and down the tooth several times. (Don't move the floss back and forth in a sawing motion. You miss cleaning the entire tooth, and the friction can irritate the gum.) Repeat on the other side of the tooth, and then the other teeth.

        4. Apply sunscreen
        Sunscreen is the best defense against skin-damaging rays. After washing your face in the morning, apply 
        a facial moisturizer that contains sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of a
         least 30. Or blend equal parts sunscreen and a regular moisturizer. Use one or two nickel-sized dollops to cover
          your entire face, neck, ears, and any bald or thinning spots on your head.</p>
